This course will give students a foundation in statistical analysis principles and practice, mainly applied to life sciences. In addition, we will have weekly lectures covering various topics, including research methodology, data collection methods, statistics, R programming, data visualization(human perception, color theory, principles of visual design), etc.

We will also have weekly hands-on laboratory sessions in which students will have the opportunity to put the lecture material into practice.


## Course Objectives
- Provides fundamentals of research methodology concepts.
- Understanding of the basic data collection principles.
- Literature database search, literature review and documentation.
- Research proposal writing and ethical approval process.
- Use of data collection tools and data management strategies.
- Statistics: the language of research.
- Provides a solid understanding of data analysis workflow in the field of health sciences.
- Understanding of the basic programming concept using R programming in the health research perspective.
- Understanding of the essential health data analysis workflow.
- Data management with dplyr(A R package for data management)
- Data visualization with ggplot2(A R package for data visualization)
- Understanding and interpreting data using descriptive statistics with R
- Understanding and interpreting data using inferential statistics with R
- Building and evaluating regressing model using R
- Building and evaluating classification model using R


## Who this course is for
- If you have no research experience but want to learn the necessary concepts in health research- then this is the right place for you to begin with.
- If you have no data analysis experience but want learn end-to-end data analysis process from data collection to report writing- then this course is a great one to start.
- If you have some experience but are not confident enough to start your project, you can start from here.
- If you are an undergrad student and planning to start your research journey, this course will surely also help you.

### Course Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites, and we do not assume any prior background in research, data analysis, or statistics.


### Assignment Policy
- 20% of your grade will be determinded by an assignment during normal class hours.
- 40% of your grade will come from a 5-10 page report that explores in further detail one of the research areas in the class syllabus. We expect that students will use orginal data collection, whether quantitative or qualitative analysis, to answer the questions posed.
- 20% of your grade will be determinded by your attendance and participation in class.
- 20% of your grade will come from 2 page research proposal writing that you must complete on two separate weeks of the class.
### Attendance Policy
Your attendance and participation grade is divided into two parts: 10% comes from your presence in class, and 10% from your participation during discussion. We will allow you to miss three classes during the program for any reason: you do not need to inform us ahead of time unless you are missing for an approved reason(i.e., university activity, sickness) and would like the absence to be expected.
